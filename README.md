# Angular ES6 seed project

This is a seed project which you can use a basis for your own AngularJS + ES6 + SystemJS + JSPM projects.

It was created as part of my project [How to build your own team chat in five days](http://fdietz.github.io/2015/04/13/day-1-how-to-build-your-own-team-chat-in-five-days.html).

## Getting started

Execute:
  1. npm install
  2. jspm install
  3. gulp (launch the server)
  4. navigate to http://localhost:8080
